The WPF application features a main window with a menu bar at the top, offering various functionalities to interact with Excel files. The File Menu provides options for Open and Exit. Selecting Open prompts the user to choose an Excel file, which the application then reads using Excel interop libraries. The Exit option closes the application. The Data Menu includes radio buttons to apply different filters to the data: Highest Value, Lowest Value, Item, Sales Rep, and Region. These filters allow users to refine the data displayed based on their criteria. The Run Report menu item triggers the generation of a report based on the selected filters.
In the code-behind (MainWindow.xaml.cs), essential components include field declarations for the Excel application and workbook, the path of the selected file, and the filter criteria. Event handlers manage interactions such as opening a file, applying filters, and running the report. Key methods include LoadExcelData, which imports data from the selected Excel file, FilterData for applying user-defined filters, and GenerateReport, which processes the filtered data and displays the results. Proper error handling ensures robustness by addressing potential issues like file errors or Excel interop failures.

Overall, this application provides a user-friendly interface for selecting Excel files, applying data filters, and generating customized reports, streamlining data analysis and reporting tasks.
